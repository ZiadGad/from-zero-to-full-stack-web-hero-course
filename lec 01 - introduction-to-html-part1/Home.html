        <h1><u>Tim Berners-Lee</u></h1>
        <hr />

        <p><strong>Tim Berners-Lee</strong> <i>(born June 8, 1955, London, England)</i> is a <b>British computer</b> scientist, generally credited as the inventor of the World Wide Web. In 2004, he was awarded a knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom and the inaugural Millennium Technology Prize (€1 million) by the Finnish Technology Award Foundation.</p>

        <p>Computing came naturally to Berners-Lee, as both of his parents worked on the Ferranti Mark I, the first commercial computer. (See computer: The first stored-program machines.) After graduating in 1976 from the University of Oxford, Berners-Lee designed computer software for two years at Plessey Telecommunications Ltd., located in Poole, Dorset, England. Following this, he had several positions in the computer industry, including a stint from <mark>June to December 1980</mark> as a software engineering consultant at CERN, the European particle physics laboratory in Geneva.</p>

        <p>hyperlink, a link between related pieces of information by electronic connections in order to allow a user easy access between them. Hypertext, a hyperlink involving text, is a feature of some <a  href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/computer-program">computer programs</a> that allow the user of electronic media to select a word from text and receive additional information pertaining to that word, such as a definition or related references within the text. In the article “whale” in an electronic encyclopaedia, for example, a hypertext link at the mention of the blue whale enables the reader to access the article on that species merely by clicking on the words “blue whale” with a mouse. The hyperlink is usually denoted by highlighting the relevant word or phrase in text with a different font or colour. Hyperlinks can also connect text with pictures, sounds, or animated sequences.</p>
        <h2>Internet</h2>
        <p>Internet, a system architecture that has revolutionized mass communication, mass media, and commerce by allowing various computer networks around the world to interconnect. Sometimes referred to as a “network of networks,” the Internet emerged in the United States in the 1970s but did not become visible to the general public until the early 1990s. By 2020, approximately 4.5 billion people, or more than half of the world’s population, were estimated to have access to the Internet. And that number is growing, largely due to the prevalence of “smart” technology and the "Internet of Things," where computer-like devices connect with the Internet or interact via wireless networks. These “things” include smartphones, appliances, thermostats, lighting systems, irrigation systems, security cameras. vehicles, even cities.</p>
